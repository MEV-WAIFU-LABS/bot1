# ‚ú®üêÆ MSOL solver üëæ‚ú® 

<br>

**This program implements a solver running arbitrage strategies for the [CoW Swap protocol](https://github.com/cowprotocol).**

<br>

> *[Solvers](https://docs.cow.fi/off-chain-services/solvers) are a key component in the Cow Protocol, serving as the matching engines that find the best execution paths for user orders*.



<br>

---

## Strategies


#### Spread trades

* One-leg limit price arbitrage trade.
* Two-legs limit price arbitrage trade for multiple execution paths.

<br>


---

## Implemented features 


#### Liquidity sources

* Support for constant-product AMMs, such as Uniswap V2 (and its forks).


#### Orders types


* Support for limit orders.
* Support for multiple orders in a user order instance.

## Execution specs





> A limit order is an order to buy or sell with a restriction on the maximum price to be paid or the minimum price to be received (the "limit price").

This limit determines when an order can be executed:

```
limit_price = sell_amount / buy_amount >= executed_buy_amount / executed_sell_amount
```

#### Surplus

For multiple execution paths (liquidity sources), we choose the best solution by maximizing the *surplus* of an order:

```
surplus = exec_buy_amount  - exec_sell_amount / limit_price
```

#### Amounts representation

All amounts are expressed by non-negative integer numbers, represented in atoms (i.e., multiples of 10^18). We add `_` to results to denote decimal position, allowing easier reading.

---

## Order specs

User orders describe a trading intent.

#### User order specs

* `sell_token`: token to be sold (added to the amm pool).
* `buy_token`: token to be bought (removed from the amm pool).
* `allow_partial_fill`: if `False`, only fill-or-kill orders are executed.
* `sell_amount`: limit amount for tokens to be sold.
* `buy_amount`: limit amount for tokens to be bought.
* `exec_sell_amount`: how many tokens get sold after order execution.

<br>

#### AMM exec specs


* `amm_exec_buy_amount`: how many tokens the amm "buys" (gets) from the user, and it's the sum of all `exec_sell_amount` amounts of each path (leg) in the order execution.
* `amm_exec_sell_amount`: how many tokens the amm "sells" (gives) to the user, and it's the sum of all `exec_buy_amount` amounts of each path (leg) in the order execution.
* `market_price`: the price to buy a token through the user order specs.
* `prior_price`: the buy price of a token in the reserve prior to being altered by the order.
* `prior_sell_token_reserve`: the initial reserve amount of the "sell" token, prior to being altered by the order.
* `prior_buy_token_reserve`: the initial reserve amount of the "buy" token, prior to being altered by the order.
* `updated_sell_token_reserve`: the reserve amount of the "sell" token after being altered by the order.
* `updated_buy_token_reserve`: the reserve amount of the "buy" token after being altered by the order.

For instance, for a user order instance:

```
{
    "orders": {
        "0": {
            "sell_token": "A",
            "buy_token": "C",
            "sell_amount": "1000_000000000000000000",
            "buy_amount": "900_000000000000000000",
            "allow_partial_fill": false,
            "is_sell_order": true
        }
    },
    "amms": {
        "AC": {
            "reserves": {
                "A": "10000_000000000000000000",
                "C": "10000_000000000000000000"
            }
        }
    }
}

```

generates the following solution:

```
{
    "amms": {
        "AC": {
            "sell_token": "C",
            "buy_token": "A",
            "exec_buy_amount": "1000_000000000000000000",
            "exec_sell_amount": "909_090909090909090909"
        }
    },
    "orders": {
        "0": {
            "allow_partial_fill": false,
            "is_sell_order": true,
            "buy_amount": "900_000000000000000000",
            "sell_amount": "1000_000000000000000000",
            "buy_token": "C",

            "exec_sell_amount": "1000_000000000000000000"
        }
    }
}
```



and for a user order instance:

<br>

```
{
    "orders": {
        "0": {
            "sell_token": "A",
            "buy_token": "C",
            "sell_amount": "1000_000000000000000000",
            "buy_amount": "900_000000000000000000",
            "allow_partial_fill": false,
            "is_sell_order": true
        }
    },
    "amms": {
        "AB2": {
            "reserves": {
                "A": "10000_000000000000000000",
                "B2": "20000_000000000000000000"
            }
        },        
        "B2C": {
            "reserves": {
                "B2": "15000_000000000000000000",
                "C": "10000_000000000000000000"
            }
        }
    }
}

#### Listing available amms in an order instance file

```
msol -a <order file>
```
<br>

Example output:

```
INFO:root:‚úÖ AMMs available for orders/instance_1.json

{   'AC': {   'reserves': {   'A': '10000_000000000000000000',
                              'C': '10000_000000000000000000'}}}
```

<br>

#### Listing orders in an order instance file

```
msol -o <order file>
```

<br>

Example output:

```
INFO:root:‚úÖ Orders for orders/instance_1.json

{   '0': {   'allow_partial_fill': False,
             'buy_amount': '900_000000000000000000',
             'buy_token': 'C',
             'is_sell_order': True,
             'sell_amount': '1000_000000000000000000',
             'sell_token': 'A'}}
```
